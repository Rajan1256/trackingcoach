/**
 * Not that long ago, in a land far from here there was a namespace change.
 * During this namespace change certain people woke up at 5AM GMT+0.
 * They created a test, with the new namespace (App\Tests).
 * During the migration of the old project the hardworking developers didn't change the namespace of the old tests.
 * This resulted in the old tests not working anymore.
 * Due to them not working they decided to move the namespace back to the old namespace (App\Topmind\Tests).
 * But sadly those who woke at 5AM ruined this easy fix.
 * So this class will stay here for ever and ever to hold the kingdom together.
 *
 * TL;DR: Class seems useless but is more useful than duct tape when your car is broken.
